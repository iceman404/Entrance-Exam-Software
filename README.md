# First Sem Project:

# Title: Entrance-Exam-Software

This is the first project made in C for the the fullfillment of Sem I project credit.
For timer and exam simultaneous implementation  --pthreads used--



# Currently I'm trying to refactor this huge pile of single file source code.
# I look into it and realize that most of the code written here is total garbage/redundant/unnecessary :D

# Anyway it is a memory of me building a C based software for the first time. :D
