# First Sem Project:

**Project Title:**  
Development of a Console-Based Test Application in C.


**Project Description:**
This project entails the creation of a console-based test application in the C programming language. The primary aim is to apply fundamental C programming concepts in the development of a functional and interactive application. Key project details include:

**Application Type:**  
- Console-based C application.

**Multithreading:**  
- Utilization of Unix pthreads to synchronize the main exam thread and timer thread. This ensures a seamless and timed test-taking experience for users.

**Student Registration:**  
- Implementation of basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for student registration. These operations allow the application to manage student records effectively.

**Online Test Simulation:**  
- The core functionality of the application involves simulating a test environment. Students can register, log in, take tests, and view their scores. The timer thread ensures that tests have a time limit, enhancing the realism of the simulation.


**Project Outcomes:**

1. Console-based online test application.
2. Effective utilization of Unix pthreads for thread synchronization.
3. Implementation of CRUD operations for student registration.


**Significance:**

This project serves as a foundational exercise in C programming, encompassing the creation of a console application, multithreading with pthreads, and the practical implementation of CRUD operations. It offers valuable hands-on experience for beginners in the field of programming and software development, emphasizing core concepts that can be applied to more complex projects in the future.
